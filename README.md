# Tech Blog

Tech Blog is an open community-driven site for everyone, whether you're a tech geek that can't get enough of the newest and hottest gadgets on the market, or just looking for some tips on your next purchase. By signin up, users can share their thoughts and interact with other members by commenting on and liking posts.

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate a robust Full Stack application with strong competency in both front-end and back-end development, using the Django framework.
